## Notes: ##



*	Average applications submitted per week = total applications submitted/ no. of weeks
*	The observed time spans 40 days, resulting in a total of 7 calendar weeks and 2 incomplete calendar weeks, i.e. weeks with less than 7 days
*	As a result of incomplete calendar weeks, the average will be misleading; hence decided to remove the incomplete weeks 
*	Removed calendar week 4 & calendar week 10, resulting in removal of data for 28th Jan & for 5th to 8th March respectively
*	The complete calendar weeks considered are from week 5 to week 9
