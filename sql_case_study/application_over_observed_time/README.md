##Notes:##

The approach followed to calculate applications over the observed period ```28th Jan 2023 â€“ 8th March 2023``` is

*	There are 3 types of applications:
  *	The first type of application is the result of grouping multiple requests into a single application if the time interval between consequent requests is less than or equal to 10 mins
  *	The second type is when the time interval between consequent requests is more than 10 mins
  *	The third type is when a user has submitted the last request 
*	The calculation is based on the fact table, requests_log
